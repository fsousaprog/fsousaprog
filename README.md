- Helo there, I’m @fsousaprog

I’m eager to learn and to improve whenever I can, and github is my place to upload my personal studies projects.

I don't usualy keep creating new repositories or uploading new features because I'm often focused on my career oy me family, 
but when I have some time I like to implement something new and if it goes well I upload it here
